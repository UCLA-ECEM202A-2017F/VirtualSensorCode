QUESTIONS:
stream name, owner ID, and method name are used to uniquely identify a stream. Current, schema has an array of method names. Which name would be used then? first? Currently I am using first element of array (StoreMetadata#146)
Answer:


One algo per input/output?
Answer: Per module (if algorithm or module produce any stream that should be persisted)

Schema flow is CHANGED! this may cause some/many bugs

NOTE:
start/end time could be removed from save-stream-object
use parse to convert string to date and don't use -13 to convert datetime to mysql format

BUG:
duplicate records in mysql
