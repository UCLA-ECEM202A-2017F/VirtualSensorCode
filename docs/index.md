## Virtual Sensor Definition
A unified framework to integrate real time sensor data for users to query.

## Data Set
1. Streaming data
2. Historical data

## User Defined Queries
Users define queries in the JSON format:
1. Input stream
2. Computation
3. Output Stream

## Project Milestones
Stage 1: input: 1 time series -> output: 1 time series <br>
Stage 2: input: 2 time series -> output: 1 time series same user <br>
Stage 3: input: 1 time series from other virtual sensor -> output: 1 time series <br>
